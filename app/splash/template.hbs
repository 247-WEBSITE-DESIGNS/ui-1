    <h2>Adding your first Host</h2>
    <p>
      Before adding your first service or launching a container, you must add at least a single Linux host that supports Docker 1.6+ and be able to reach the Rancher server via HTTP.
      Rancher supports adding Linux hosts in the form of a virtual or physical machine from any public cloud providers, privately hosted clouds, or even baremetal servers.

    <h2>Adding your first Service</h2>
    <p>
      A service is simply a group of containers created from the same Docker image but extends Docker's &quot;link&quot; concept to leverage Rancher's lightweight distributed DNS service for service discovery.
      A service also is also capable of leveraging other Rancher built-in services such as load balancers, health monitoring, upgrade support, and high-availability.
